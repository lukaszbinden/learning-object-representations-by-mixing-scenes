the discriminator needs the cross entropy loss function above since it has a very specific function (to discriminate among two classes) and the cross entropy is the “best” way of doing this. cf. https://danieltakeshi.github.io/2017/03/05/understanding-generative-adversarial-networks/

GAN regularization: gradient penalty, dragan penalty, L2 regularization
